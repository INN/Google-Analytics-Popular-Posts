# Google Analytics Popular Posts Widget

Now that you have things set up to connect to Google Analytics, you can begin using the Google Analytics Popular Posts widget to display popular posts in a sidebar or other widget area. The widget will display a set number of headlines of the most popular posts as either an ordered list (numbered) or an unordered list (just the headlines with no numbers). 

## Configure the GA Popular Posts widget

Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and you'll see a widget named Google Analytics Popular Posts. Add it to a sidebar or other widget area and configure the settings as desired:
