### Note specific to Google Analytics Popular Posts:

It is possible to do development work on this plugin without configuring the plugin to work with Google, for some forms of development work. Front-end development work will work, as the plugin's widget will be filled with the most-recent posts instead of using posts based on their analytics-derived popularity.
