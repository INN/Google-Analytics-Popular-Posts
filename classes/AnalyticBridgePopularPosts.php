			 * A note on the calculation of weighted pageviews, using a simplified equation:
			 *
			 * ( ( today's sessions * $ratio ) + ( yesterday's sessions * ( 1 - $ratio ) ) returns the post's sessions count, averaged between the last 24 hours.
			 * ( sessions count ) * 1/2 ^ ( ( post date - now ) / ( $halflife * 24 ) ) multiplies this post's sessions count by the half-life equation.
			 * The half-life equation raises 1/2 to the power n, where n is the number of half-lifes elapsed.
			 * $half-life is set in the plugin options in Settings > Analytic Bridge > Post halflife. It is the half-life of post popularity, in days.
			 * A post will count half as much every $halflife days.
			 * ( post date - now ) returns hours.
			 * ( $halflife * 24 ) returns hours.
			 * Dividing the post's age by the halflife-hours gives the number of half-lives that have elapsed, and thus the power that 1/2 should be raised to.
